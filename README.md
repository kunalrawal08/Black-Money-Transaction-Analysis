# 💼 Black Money Transaction Analysis

### 📊 A Comprehensive Data Analysis Project on Black Money Transactions

This project aims to analyze, visualize, and uncover insights from financial transactions potentially linked to black money. Using Python and data science tools, this project explores patterns and anomalies within the data to provide a deeper understanding of suspicious activities. The main tools used include **Streamlit** for interactive dashboards, **pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation, and various visualization libraries to represent the results.
